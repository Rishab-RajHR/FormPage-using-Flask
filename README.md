A Thank-You page confirms successful submission of a form or user action.

Create an endpoint in Flask (e.g., /thankyou) using a route function.

Pass dynamic data such as the user’s name or feedback via render_template().

Use a dedicated HTML template like thankyou.html inside the templates/ folder.

Display confirmation messages and optional details from the submitted form.

Use Jinja2 placeholders ({{ }}) inside the template for dynamic content.

Redirect to the Thank-You page after form submission using redirect() and url_for().

Keep design simple, responsive, and user-friendly.
